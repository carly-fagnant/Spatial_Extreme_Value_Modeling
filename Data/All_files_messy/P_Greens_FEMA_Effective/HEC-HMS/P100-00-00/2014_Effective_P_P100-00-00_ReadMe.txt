FEMA Case Number: 10-06-2789P
FEMA Effective Date: 06/09/2014

Notes: (1) A FEMA Study for only part of Greens Bayou watershed created a new HEC-HMS model for Garner Creek (P130-00-00). 
This P100-00-00 HMS model was updated combined with the new P130-00-00 model.  TC&R Table has been updated. (2) Error was discovered in the previous 
combination of models. Re-uploaded 2.2.2017 with corrected routing.
