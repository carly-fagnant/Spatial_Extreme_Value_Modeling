Update 1:
The effective FEMA hydraulic model for unit number B100-00-00 has been updated by FEMA LOMR 14-06-4559P with an effective date of 10/16/2015.
*Flows are distributed to the HEC-RAS model as follows: "A100_XXPCT_LOMR" from most upstream point downstream to cross section 51320.59; and from "A100_XXPCT" downstream of cross section 51320.59 to confluence with A100-00-00 (Clear Creek).
