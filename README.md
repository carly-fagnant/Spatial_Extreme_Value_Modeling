# Spatial_Extreme_Value_Modeling

This repository contains code that accompanies Chapter 5 of Carlynn Fagnant's Thesis, "Spatiotemporal Extreme Value Modeling with Environmental Applications". 

Code for the three models (PARE, Block Kriging, Regional Max) is in the code folder in the file "Testing_on_Real_Data.R". This file depends on some other files which are large and will need to be generated locally.

Note that the code is a few years old and may need minimal updates in light of the spatial package migrations.
