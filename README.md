# Spatial_Extreme_Value_Modeling

This repository contains code that accompanies Chapter 5 of Carlynn Fagnant's Thesis, "Spatiotemporal Extreme Value Modeling with Environmental Applications". 

Note that the code is a few years old and may need minimal updates in light of the spatial package migrations.
